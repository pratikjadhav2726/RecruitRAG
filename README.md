# RecruitRAG: Agentic email generator 

### AI-Powered Cold Email Generation using RAG, LangChain, and Llama 3  

---

## üìå Project Overview  

This project is an **AI-powered cold email generator** built using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LangChain, and Llama 3**, designed to **automate personalized outreach and improve recruiter response rates**.  

### There are three different approaches, implemented on separate branches:
####  1.  Basic RAG with LangChain ‚Äì Uses standard retrieval-augmented generation.
#### 	2.	Agentic RAG with LangChain Agents ‚Äì Implements autonomous agent behavior for query understanding and email construction.
####  3.	Agentic RAG with LangGraph ‚Äì Adds retry mechanisms using coherence and RAG score checks for enhanced precision.

### üî• Features:  
‚úÖ **RAG-based AI model**: Enhances contextual relevance in email generation.  
‚úÖ **ChromaDB Integration**: Efficient **vector-based candidate-job matching** for skill-based recommendations.  
‚úÖ **Streamlit UI**: Recruiters can generate tailored cold emails **in under 30 seconds**, boosting efficiency by **40%**.  
‚úÖ **Enhanced Engagement**: Personalized AI-generated emails improve recruiter response rates **by 30%**.  

### MCP Server Integration: 
We plan to integrate Model Context Protocol (MCP) server capabilities to enhance RecruitRAG‚Äôs functionality. This will enable seamless integration with external data sources, third-party services, messaging platforms, scheduling tools, and advanced analytics. These additions will empower dynamic, context-aware interactions across multiple channels, improving both efficiency and user experience.

### Branches and Approaches

| Branch                          | Approach                          | Key Features                                                                            |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Cold-email-generator`          | Basic RAG with LangChain          | Simple RAG-based retrieval and email generation.                                        |
| `Agentic-Rag-LangChain-Agents`  | Agentic RAG with LangChain Agents | Uses agents for dynamic tool selection. |
| `Agentic-Rag_LangGraph`         | Agentic RAG with LangGraph        | Adds coherence and RAG score validation with retries for improved accuracy.             |

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Basic RAG with LangChain (Cold-email-generator branch)
	‚Ä¢	Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for contextual relevance.
	‚Ä¢	Basic retrieval and email generation with no agent involvement.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Agentic RAG with LangChain Agents (Agentic-Rag-LangChain-Agents branch)
	‚Ä¢	Introduces LangChain agents for query understanding and multi-step execution.
	‚Ä¢	Automates data retrieval, filtering, and email generation dynamically.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Agentic RAG with LangGraph (Agentic-Rag_LangGraph branch)
	‚Ä¢	Implements LangGraph for structured execution.
	‚Ä¢	Coherence and RAG Score Validation:
	‚Ä¢	If coherence < 0.8, the job extraction step retries.
	‚Ä¢	If RAG score < 0.8, retrieval step retries before generating the email.

## üèóÔ∏è Tech Stack  

- **üìå Llama 3** ‚Äì AI-powered natural language generation  
- **üìå LangChain** ‚Äì Framework for RAG-based AI workflows  
- **üìå ChromaDB** ‚Äì Vector database for candidate-job matching  
- **üìå Streamlit** ‚Äì User-friendly web UI  
- **üìå Python** ‚Äì Backend logic and model integration
- **üìå LangSmith** ‚Äì Tracebility and Observability

## üéØ How It Works  

1. **User Input**: Recruiters enter details about the candidate, job role, and desired personalization.  
2. **Data Retrieval**: ChromaDB fetches relevant job-candidate matches using **vector embeddings**.  
3. **RAG-powered Generation**: LangChain + Llama 3 generate **highly personalized** cold emails.
4. **Agentic RAG and LangGraph Versions**:
	‚Ä¢	LangChain Agents dynamically route and process retrieval.
	‚Ä¢	LangGraph ensures adaptive execution, retrying steps if coherence or RAG scores are low. 
5. **UI Display**: The generated email is displayed in **Streamlit**, ready to be copied and sent.
